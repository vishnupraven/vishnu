DAY 1 - BLOCK CHAIN ASSINGNMENT
 
1) What is your understanding of Block chain ? 
 It's a technology called block chain, a global online 
database. It is a cryptographically linked list of records. Block 
chain is a structure that keeps transactional records and ensures 
security and decentralization. Cheating the system by faking 
documents, transactions and other information are nearly 
impossible.
 
2) What is the core problem Block chain is trying to 
solve ? 
 
 Cross-Border Payments
 Identity theft
 Lack of transparency
 Managing and protecting data of clients in some 
organisation
 Piracy issues
3) What are the few features which Block chain will give 
you ? 
 
 Immutable
 Verifiable
 Tamper proof
 Decentralized
 Enhanced Security
4)What all things does a block contain ? 
 
 Block Number
 Previous block Signature
 New Records
 Mining
5)How verifiability of Block chain has been attained ? 
 The data is stored across multiple sites throughout the 
internet. If any discrepancy is observed at a particular site then it 
can be rectified by verifying data at other sites. In this way 
verifiability is achieved.
 Data = key0
 key0+New Data = key1
 key1+New Data = key2
